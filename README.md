# Mario
Just playing around to see what went into making a platformer game like Mario. Has not been updated since early 2017, as this was just an exercise for myself. Most of the key features and game mechanics (enemy AI, powerups, wall jumping and sliding, pipes and hidden rooms, one-way platforms, etc) are functional.
